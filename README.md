"watch re:stage" - sun tzu, the art of war

Do you ever felt that your life has been a little boring recently? Do you think that there is nothing left in this world to be explored, therefore making your life meaningless? If you think so, you have come to the right place. By doing this simple trick, you will decrease your suicide rate by 200%.

In this capitalist world, everything is dominated by wealth. People fell for stupid ~~stars~~ stuffs like NFTs, shitcoins, etc. Tech companies are becoming more and more souless everyday. Free software activists are now called pedophiles, open source people are full of SJWs. The situation is a lot worse in social medias. People farming karma on HN, Reddit, cancelling each other on the bird app, hacking each other's account and then saying dumb stuff like:

```
You can't rely on one, even a small light
If you hold hands, you see, it will change to a constellation
Such a scenery that cannot be seen alone is born
Even on a dark road that seems to be lost
You can use that light as a landmark and step forward.
```

This world needs a re~~:~~set.
