"watch re:stage" - sun tzu, the art of war

Do you ever felt that your life has been a little boring Re:cently? Do you think that theRe: is nothing left in this world to be exploRe:d, theRe:foRe: making your life meaningless? If you think so, you have come to the right place. By doing this simple trick, you will decRe:ase your suicide rate by 200%.

In this capitalist world, everything is dominated by wealth. People fell for stupid ~~stars~~ stuffs like NFTs, shitcoins, etc. Tech companies are becoming moRe: and moRe: souless everyday. FRe:e softwaRe: activists aRe: now called pedophiles, open source people aRe: full of SJWs. The situation is a lot worse in social medias. People farming karma on HN, Re:ddit, cancelling each other on the bird app, hacking each other's account and then saying dumb stuff like:

```
You can't rely on one, even a small light
If you hold hands, you see, it will change to a constellation
Such a scenery that cannot be seen alone is born
Even on a dark road that seems to be lost
You can use that light as a landmark and step forward.
```

This world needs a Re:set. Maybe a solar storm will do the work, leaving self-proclaimed "data scientist" with their programmer socks with no job opportunities, giving back wealth to the non-tech people, who have been suffering in the last 20 years or so.

Now, let's fly to a country in East Asia, Japan. Its economy is quite stable, although the nation has been suffering from various population issues. Re:garding cultuRe:, Japanese people has a rich otaku cultuRe:, with a tRe:mendous amount of anime, manga, video games, etc. But theRe: has been a noticable degradation of those things' quality.

Take 2D idol franchises for example (we aRe: gonna also include stuff like band anime, such as bandori and k-on), the game concepts aRe: very Re:petitive. Rhythm games like bandori, d4dj or prosekai aRe: just reskins of osu mania, and without official custom beatmap support (you have to go to some weird site and download a weird app to play custom maps, cringe). SIFAS (sigh) is not even a rhythm game, lapis Re: light is 3d magiRe:co, idoly pride is (rip kanda sayaka), an idol training app or sth idk.

~~Tonikaku~~ Anyways, as people who type stuff to make the computer do stuff, while listening and simping for some 2D girls that aRe: not even Re:al, we aRe: fucked.

That's what I felt befoRe: the moment.

And after that, my life has changed, foRe:ver.

Just like girls meet love, gazing into the same dRe:am under the same sky, grab the hand and stood up, pRe:paRe: for a passionate and juvenile<del->-technoplanet</del> attempt, I have become a new person, and the world has turned into an atarashii sekai.

And that moment is what I will never forget. I'm suRe: that this feeling will continue throughout four seasons. Yes, I'm suRe: of it.

Do you want the same thing to happen to yourself?

Do you want to start a new era, an era with only sweet youthful days of dRe:ams and passion, and without the pain you have been suffering?

A long time ago, my favorite osu! player, mRe:kk (also known as rushia1, sakamata1, plswatchRe:stage1, watchitifnotkys1, watchitoryouaRe:goingtothebackroomsanddieonlevel727wheRe:theyplayangelyellfor800hoursstraight1), set a pRe:tty impRe:ssive scoRe: on the map KiRaRe - 367Days, mapped by the gigachad mapper, \_kotachi_. The play Re:warded him with 924 performance points. But what make me wonder is the title of the song. As everyone (including people that doesn't watch re:stage ~~kill yourself you don't deserve to live, i swear i will kill all of your family, and fuck yo mama befoRe: that~~) know, a common year consists of 365 days, and a leap one has 366 days. TheRe: aRe: no years with 367 days, which is what the title is saying.

I listened to the song and felt in love with it. The vocal was perfect, the instrumental was a masterpiece. Just like a singer has sung: "te o no bashite", this song is the basest song ever I've heard.

But it didn't stop theRe:.

I checked out other KiRaRe's songs, and to my surprise, they aRe: all bangers (well except winter jewels that song sucks, but still better than vocaloid shit with edgy background of miku being a cRe:atuRe: that drink blood and shitty Re:petitive instrumental which got moRe: views than all KiRaRe's songs combined).

Then I looked at other units.

ortensia, which consists of two ~~lesbians~~ girls who can't live without each other. The song "Yes, We Are!" filled my mind with jumps.

Stellamaris, ~~no it's not a stella-re:um Re:feRe:nce~~, ... their song aRe: mediocre (but still better than some weird songs with edgy vocal and a cringe hopping girl which got moRe: views than all KiRaRe's songs combined).

But theRe: is a chiisana problem, the franchise is kind of underrated. It doesn't have a subRe:ddit, its discord server is small (but comfy and based). I want to do something about this.

This is why you, can change the world, by shilling this franchise. Just copy this RE:ADME (or the github link) and spam it in any comment section you can see. By doing that, the franchise will grow, and the possibility for Re:Stage season 2 will incRe:ase, which will give us moRe: based content.

To conclude, let me quote some people:

“You've gotta dance like theRe:'s nobody watching,  
Love like you'll never be hurt,  
Sing like theRe:'s nobody listening,  
And watch Re:Stage.”  
― William W. Purkey

“Without Re:Stage, life would be a mistake.”  
― Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols
